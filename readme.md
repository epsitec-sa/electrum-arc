# Arc, a collection of [Agnostic](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agnostic) React Components

This repository contains work in progress. It is by no means stable and should
not be used in projects for now.

Formerly, `electrum-arc` had to be used as a submodule (e.g. in Lydia, where
project `Lydia.Arc.Components` relied on `arc` through the magic of npm
aliases).

Our goal is to provide a real npm package, which can be consumed together
with `electrum` and a pre-configured `E` instance.
